ðŸŽ® Excited to Share My Latest Project! ðŸŽ®

I recently built a snake game using JavaScript, bringing a classic game to life with a modern twist! The game features three difficulty levels: Easy, Medium, and Hard, and players get three chances to challenge themselves and aim for a high score. Developing this game was a fun and rewarding experience that enhanced my problem-solving skills and understanding of game mechanics.

I'm excited about how this project turned out and look forward to exploring more game development projects. Iâ€™d love to hear your thoughts or suggestions! ðŸ˜Š
